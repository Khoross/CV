\section{Personal Statement}
\begin{entrylist}
\entrybasic{}{}{}{}
{

\quad Working as an analyst has deeper insight into the value of data, and has led me to want to use this understanding more directly.
After starting my initial role as an Associate Analyst at GlobalData I was swiftly promoted to full Analyst thanks to my advanced data manipulation abilities.
When the project my team was working on matured, I played a key role in preparing our data and files for handover to the new team who would be maintainng it.
%In my time working for GlobalData I developed models allowing us to provide data on hard to find indicators for a very diverse set of locations.
%I also played a key role in the process of wrapping up the initial project I worked on, and handing over the project to the team in Hyderabad who would be maintaining it from then on.

\quad Since the conclusion of my initial project, I was transferred to our corporate team as an Associate Data Scientist working directly under our CDO.
This transfer has allowed me to hone my skills with Python and R, particularly in language processing for name matching.

\quad As an undergraduate I obtained reliably good marks over my time at university while taking over 110\% of the expected course load, demonstrating a drive to succeed above and beyond the constraints of the qualification and a passion for learning.
I simultaneously served as treasurer for a large and highly active society, the Science Fiction and Fantasy Society, where we arranged a large increase in society activities.

%I enjoyed the responsibility of managing our accounts and successfully resolved the Â£500 debt of the previous administrations, while working within the executive team to greatly expand our range of activities.
%By the time of my departure we had expanded dramatically from weekly meetings and twice termly events to a wide range of different weekly events, from role-playing games to book meetings.\\
%\quad I have long wanted my work to have an impact; as such during university holidays I found  my first job volunteering for the British Red Cross, where I worked as the sole public-facing member of the shop staff during my shifts.

\quad After moving on from my undergraduate degree I secured funding from the EPSRC for a PhD in statistics.
While performing my research, I also worked with a great many first year students as a tutor to ease them into university level mathematics, probability, and statistics; not only new mathematics intake, but also a handful of students from other sciences as needed.
My time in academia allows me to rapidly develop capabilities in many mathematical areas as needed, a skill I have put to good use while determining optimal forecasting models.

%Each year, it is very rewarding to see the improvement in the students understanding over the year, but most of all when a student brings their own problem that I can work them through to expand their understanding.
\quad I enjoy data estimation and vizualization, and in my spare time am working to improve my skills in machine learning based regression and forecasting methods.

%I teach statistics good
%I like charities and want to help
%I am not an idiot
%I can handle money

{Associate Data Scientist}
{My primary task as an associate data scientist is investigating our internal databases to allow for more complex analysis of client behaviour and the construction of predictive models; this involves quality analysis, provenance generation, and linking data sources with only weak connections. I also worked on a project to build an initial predictive model for large orders, which provides insight into key factors influencing sales.}

{2011--2016}
{University of Bath}{PhD Student}
{Bath}
{I researched the field of percolation, with a focus on certain continuum and discrete models with long range dependencies. My key tasks included literature searching, analysis of existing results in the field, and improvements upon the existing knowledge. Finally, I produced a summary of the current state of knowledge in a section of the field, to best know where to look for improvements.}

%this needs to be stripped to bulletpoints. 10 lines at most.
%did X which enhanced Y
\begin{itemize}
\item  Having taken over society accounts carrying a large debt of approximately \pounds 500, I rapidly began examining similar societies, and quickly determined a plan of action to recover.
\item As a key member of the executive of a large society I played an important role in attracting new members each year and helping them integrate into the society as a whole, improving my ability to build rapport.
\item As a bell ringer and having been on several guild outings, I have had experience socialising with large groups.
\item Also as a bell ringer I have over the years increased my capacity to concentrate hard on a specific task for reasonable lengths of time, while maintaining coordination with the rest of the group.
\item Spending time running role-playing games for groups of 4-5 people, I have learned how to organise small groups to arrange times for meetings, and to quickly adapt to counter unforseen circumstances.
\item While running role-playing games the players will frequently abort their planned courses of actions and do something completely out of left field. As such I have needed to develop the ability to rapidly adapt existing plans for new situations.
\end{itemize}
%As Treasurer of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Society at the University of Warwick, I had to rapidly learn the ins and outs of the Student Union's finance system; the previous treasurer left for Tasmania the week after the elections, and the society had started with a substantial debt. I looked into the situation, and after comparison with similar societies judged that we could solve the debt and produce an ongoing general fund for future years if we started charging a small membership fee without having any appreciable drop in membership or engagement.
%
%I then arranged a meeting of the executive committee to discuss the situation, and persuaded them to implement my plan, which met with great success both in ensuring solvency and in demonstrating to the Union that we were fiscally responsible enough to be given additional funds to allow for expansion of our activities.
%
%\vspace{7pt} 
%
%As a bellringer for many years I have learned to maintain concentration on a single task for great lengths of time, while also paying attention to my fellow ringers to ensure good coordination and to a memorized pattern to follow. I have rung in a great many quarter peals (a continuous effort lasting around 45 minutes and consisting of approx 1260 changes) that have been completed without error, as well as two full peals, one on tower bells and one on handbells.
%
%In addition to concentration, coordination and memorization, bellringing has taught me to get along easily with other bellringers, both in socializing after meetings and quietly while others are ringing. Bellringers are a diverse group, and there are invariably interesting stories to be heard on a practise night. 
%
%\vspace{7pt}
%
%As someone who organises and runs small group roleplaying games, I once again demonstrate my ability to coordinate groups of people in gathering players that I believe would be interested to participate in these games and arranging alternate times for the games at short notice should unexpected events require rescheduling. I also demonstrate adaptability, by adjusting the planned course of the game on the fly to keep all the players engaged and in rapidly determining the potential repurcussions of their actions when the players do something completely unplanned for.
%Treasurer of society: identify problem, learn systems to fix, coordinate exec to arrange fix, implementation
%GM: gather a group of people for a task, keep them on track, continually produce ideas to give them a goal to work towards, improv like there's no tomorrow when they go off script
%bellringing: concentrating for long periods of time, coordinating with other people, getting along with groups of people
